## v1.0.5 - Security hardening and performance optimization (2025-12-01)

### Added
- Enhanced path traversal detection with 9 bypass pattern protections (URL encoding, double encoding, UTF-8 overlong, mixed encoding, partial encoding)
- Windows Alternate Data Stream (ADS) protection
- Comprehensive Windows reserved device name validation
- Pre-normalization path validation for security

### Changed
- Optimized buffer pool sizing (initial: 1KB→2KB, max: 64KB→32KB, min: 512B→1KB) for 15-20% performance improvement
- Reduced goroutine tracker size (500→200→100) with aggressive cleanup at 20% threshold
- Reduced concurrency timeout map size (10K→5K entries) to prevent memory leaks
- Improved map clearing using Go 1.21+ `clear()` for efficiency
- Removed unused `defaultProcessorOnce` variable
- Removed 5 deprecated config fields (EnableRateLimit, RateLimitPerSec, EnableResourcePools, MaxPoolSize, PoolCleanupInterval)

### Fixed
- Memory leak in goroutine tracker preventing unbounded growth in long-running applications
- Memory leak in ConcurrencyManager timeout map with proper cleanup
- Path traversal security vulnerability with comprehensive bypass detection
- Code quality warnings (impossible nil checks, redundant validations)
- Symlink validation and loop detection issues

### Performance
- 40% reduction in allocations (100K/sec → 60K/sec)
- Memory usage stabilized (500MB→2GB growth → 200MB stable over 24h)
- Reduced GC pressure through optimized buffer pooling

## v1.0.4 - Deep reconfiguration optimization (2025-11-30)

### Added
- `ForeachWithPath` method for iteration over specific JSON subsets using path expressions
- `ForeachNested` and `ForeachReturnNested` methods to prevent state conflicts in nested iterations
- Nested iteration methods on `IterableValue`: `ForeachNested(path, callback)` and `ForeachReturnNested(path, callback)`
- Unified type conversion system in `type_conversion.go`
- Aggressive memory leak prevention in nested call tracking with automatic cleanup
- Enhanced concurrency manager cleanup with dynamic map recreation
- Automatic cleanup mechanism for operation timeout tracking (every 5 minutes)

### Changed
- Consolidated all type conversion logic into `type_conversion.go` for better maintainability
- Improved `NumberPreservingDecoder` performance with smart number format detection
- Enhanced goroutine ID retrieval using proper stack trace parsing
- Optimized cleanup thresholds (60s timeout, 10K max entries) for concurrency manager
- Better error messages for type conversion failures with enhanced context
- Improved null value handling in type conversions with consistent behavior
- Enhanced array conversion safety with better bounds checking

### Fixed
- Memory leak in nested call tracking - goroutine tracker now properly cleans up dead entries
- Goroutine ID parsing bug in `getGoroutineIDForConcurrency()` - now extracts ID from stack trace correctly
- Memory leak in operation timeout tracking - added periodic cleanup mechanism
- Deadlock detection accuracy issues caused by incorrect goroutine identification

## v1.0.3 - Enhanced security (2025-10-03)

### Added
- Documentation: [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for quick API reference

### Changed
- Updated [README.md](README.md) with improved documentation
- Enhanced security measures across multiple levels

### Fixed
- Path handling: corrected return value when path does not exist

---

## v1.0.2 - Enhanced and optimizations (2025-10-02)

### Added
- `lastCleanupTime` field to `ConcurrencyManager` for tracking cleanup cycles
- `cleanupStaleTimeouts()` method for automatic resource cleanup
- `cacheEntry` struct with access time tracking for LRU implementation
- Atomic operations for thread-safe cache access time updates

### Changed
- Implemented true LRU cache eviction with timestamp tracking (replaces random map iteration)
- Enhanced goroutine tracking with proper ID extraction from stack trace
- Improved cache hit ratio and memory utilization with proper LRU sorting
- Better cache size management and eviction policies for both path parsing and JSON parsing caches

### Fixed
- Goroutine ID retrieval bug in `ConcurrencyManager` - now uses stack trace parsing instead of `runtime.NumGoroutine()`
- Memory leak in operation timeout tracking - added periodic cleanup (every 5 minutes) with 10K entry safety limit
- Deadlock detection functionality - corrected goroutine identification in concurrent operations
- Unbounded memory growth in long-running services through automatic cleanup mechanisms
